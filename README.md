# JobFlow
JobFlow is a web app that helps you organize your job search in one place. It lets users track applications across stages, store company/contact info, attach notes and links, and set follow-up reminders so nothing slips. It also includes a dashboard with filters and basic analytics to show what’s working and where to focus.
